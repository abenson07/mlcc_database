# Supabase Migrations Directory

All database schema changes must be created as migration files in this directory.

## Naming Convention

Migration files must be named with timestamp prefix:
```
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_feature_name.sql
```

Example: `20250111120000_add_route_assignments.sql`

## Workflow

1. Create migration: `supabase migration new feature_name`
2. Write SQL in the generated file
3. Test locally (if using local Supabase): `npm run db:reset`
4. Push to remote: `npm run db:migrate`
5. Regenerate types: `npm run db:types`

## Important

- Never modify tables directly in Supabase dashboard
- Always use migrations for schema changes
- Always enable RLS and create policies
- Always regenerate types after migrations
